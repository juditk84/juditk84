### Hey! Judit here!

ðŸ‘¾I'm a computer enthusiast that started her journey at 9 years old tweaking the config.sys file in her parentâ€™s 386 computer to be able to play Simon the Sorcerer.ðŸ‘¾
ðŸŒšStill with the same curiosity for the inner workings of things, passionate about music from both sides of the applause, amazed by both indie and AAA technological marvels.ðŸŒš

#### I've just released a retro Point&Click funky portfolio! 
I would love it if you checked it out ^^
